              <p> EERC embarked on a comprehensive project to address pressing societal challenges in a
proposed project site through the implementation of Nature-based Solutions (NbS). The
project unfolded in several phases, beginning with a meticulous review of existing legislative
frameworks for NbS, ensuring alignment with international standards and local contexts.
This review incorporated analyses of primary laws, regulations, and secondary sources, such
as reports from governmental agencies and NGOs, with a specific focus on climate

vulnerability assessments. EERC prioritized the integration of Gender Equality and Social
Inclusion (GESI) lenses throughout the review process, recognizing the importance of
addressing differential impacts across various social groups.

Subsequently, EERC conducted climate vulnerability analyses of two major watersheds,
namely the Khageri and Gindri watersheds. This analysis provided crucial insights into the
vulnerabilities of these ecosystems and informed the identification and prioritization of NbS
interventions. Stakeholder engagement played a pivotal role in this phase, ensuring
inclusivity and the consideration of diverse perspectives. Through participatory processes,
stakeholders, including indigenous peoples and local communities, contributed to the
identification of pressing societal challenges, guided by principles of equity and
sustainability. Building upon the insights gained from the situation analysis and stakeholder
engagement, EERC conducted a systemic review of implemented NbS interventions. This
review aimed to compile a comprehensive list of potential NbS interventions, considering the
findings from the situation analysis and the diverse needs and priorities of the stakeholders.
Cost-benefit analysis was conducted to inform the development of a project document, which
served as a blueprint for the implementation of NbS interventions. Concurrently, EERC

            <p className="text-gray-600 p-2 overflow-scroll">
              <p>EERC undertook a comprehensive project in Sanni Tribeni Rural Municipality, focusing on
landslide risk management, which included an assessment of geological conditions,
proposing cost-effective technologies, enhancing local knowledge, and developing contingency plans. Initially, a detailed assessment of the municipality's geology was
conducted, examining factors such as soil composition, slope stability, and rainfall patterns. This involved analyzing existing geological data, conducting field visits, surveys, and
interviews with experts and community members.

Moreover, climate trend analysis and precipitation analysis were conducted to understand
historical patterns and trends. This analysis provided insights into the climatic conditionsaffecting
 landslide occurrences in the area. Additionally, climate and precipitation
projections were generated using Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios 4.5
and 8.5. These projections offered valuable insights into potential future climate conditions
and precipitation patterns, enabling better anticipation of landslide risks under different
climate change scenarios. Based on these findings, cost-effective technologies suitable for
the local context were identified and evaluated for their sustainability and effectiveness in
reducing landslide risks. Concurrently, training programs were organized for local masons
and rural municipality engineers, emphasizing low-cost landslide risk management measures.
Hands-on training sessions were conducted at selected sites to pilot the implementation of
these measures, ensuring knowledge transfer and empowerment of the local workforce.

Furthermore, cost calculations were prepared for implementing low-cost landslide risk
management measures across the entire landslide-prone area. The municipality's landscape
was categorized into three categories based on risk levels: safer locations with lower
landslide risk (CAT-I), areas with the possibility of implementing mitigation measures
(CAT-II), and settlements requiring relocation due to high landslide risk (CAT-III). The
implications and socio-economic benefits of implementing cost-effective technologies were
thoroughly assessed, taking into account potential positive impacts on the community.
Finally, a comprehensive landslide contingency plan was developed, outlining strategies for
immediate response, evacuation procedures, communication protocols, and coordination
mechanisms. This plan was revised in coordination with local and provincial government
authorities to align with new findings and recommendations regarding landslide risk
management. Engagement with stakeholders ensured their involvement and commitment to
implementing the contingency plan and the revised District Preparedness and Response Plan
(DPRP). Overall, EERC's integrated approach aimed to enhance landslide risk management
and build community resilience in Sanni Tribeni Rural Municipality, considering both
current geological conditions and future climate change scenarios.</p>

custom Google Earth Engine script was developed to process satellite imagery and generates
maps illustrating flood extents over the past decade. To support flood modelling, hydro-
meteorological data from relevant stations within and near the target area were collected,
aiding in the identification of drainage systems. Flood inundation maps were meticulously
prepared for various return periods, integrating climate models and scenarios to project future
flood risks accurately. The validation of models and maps was conducted meticulously by
comparing them with observed flood events, historical records, remote sensing products, and
community consultations, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the flood risk and
vulnerability assessments. By amalgamating the outcomes of flood inundation mapping with
the flood risk and vulnerability assessments, EERC produced comprehensive flood risk
maps. These maps furnished invaluable insights into areas at high risk of flooding, thereby
assisting communities and stakeholders in prioritizing mitigation and adaptation measures to
bolster resilience against future flood events. Through tight collaboration with CRS and local
communities, EERC ensured that the flood risk and vulnerability assessments were finely
tailored to address the specific needs and challenges encountered by communities in the

             Assessment and Training Package on Climate Change Adaptation and Nature-Based
Solutions (NbS) –IFRC British Redcross
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-600 p-2">
              <p>EERC conducted a comprehensive assessment and planning process focused on climate-
smart programming and ecosystem-based assessments. Initially, a thorough desktop review

analysed national and local climate change documentation, historical data, and ecosystem
descriptions, identifying threats and potential drivers. EERC accompanied the project team
during climate-smart programming, verifying secondary data and conducting transect walks
to understand socio-economic resilience dimensions and ecosystem services. EERC
Conducted ecological assessments for each target community, updated based on on-site visits
and current data, analysing future opportunities and threats, and recommending nature-based
solutions. EERC documented NbS practices implemented by communities, detailing
challenges faced and addressed during implementation. Overall, EERC's work provided a
comprehensive understanding of climate change impacts on ecosystem services, guiding the
development of tailored nature-based solutions for each community. In addition to the tasks
outlined previously, EERC conducted a detailed vulnerability assessment and geohazard
assessment of the watershed areas in wards 17 and 19 of Dhangadhi Sub-metropolitan City,
including the upstream Churea area. This assessment focused on identifying the specific
vulnerabilities of these areas to climate change impacts, such as increased frequency of
extreme weather events, changes in precipitation patterns, and shifts in temperature regimes.
By analysing the socio-economic and environmental factors contributing to vulnerability,
EERC identified areas of heightened risk and potential impacts on ecosystem services. This
detailed vulnerability assessment informed the development of climate-resilient Nature-based
Solutions (NbS) activities tailored to address the specific challenges faced by these
communities. Integrating the findings of this assessment into the broader planning process
ensured that NbS interventions were designed to enhance community resilience in the face of
climate change.</p>

            Outcome Survey of Climate Adaptation Interventions-USAID Tayar Nepal
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-600 p-2">
            <p> EERC was hired to conduct an outcome monitoring survey on climate change adaptation
interventions to assess their effectiveness and identify areas for improvement. The specific
objective of the survey was to evaluate the outcomes of project indicators, particularly the
number of people using climate information or implementing risk-reducing actions to
enhance resilience to climate change, with support from USG Assistance.
The survey covered 8 partner municipalities within Tayar Nepal, encompassing diverse
geographic regions. These included hilly areas such as Bhimeshwor, Neelakantha, and Dullu,
inner valleys like Tulsipur and Birendranagar, and Tarai regions including Rajapur,
Lamkichuha, and Godawari. Each of these regions faced distinct climate challenges, with
Tarai municipalities primarily affected by flooding, while others grappled with erosion and
landslides.
The survey assessed the outcomes of various field-level interventions directly implemented
within the project areas. These interventions ranged from flood control through embankment
construction to landslide mitigation via stone wall construction, check-dam installation, trail
improvements, bioengineering initiatives, and the establishment of early warning systems.
Additionally, livelihood and greening projects such as tree plantations, forest fire
management, environmental education in schools, climate-smart agriculture promotion,
agroforestry initiatives, and insurance schemes for agriculture and livestock were examined.
EERC's approach extended beyond field interventions to include the dissemination of
Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) messages through diverse Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) materials. These materials, including Public Service Announcements
(PSAs), radio jingles, videos, brochures, booklets, handbooks, and television programs like
the Dukkha Series, aimed to raise awareness and engagement among target communities.
Through its comprehensive survey methodology and expertise in climate change adaptation
initiatives, EERC provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of interventions and
contributed to informed decision-making for further enhancing resilience to climate change
in Nepal's diverse municipalities. </p>
